# This reuses a lot of the same code as the capture, but everything is subtely
# different enough that it is easier and cleaner to copy/paste chunks of code
# instead of pushing the logic into abstract layers.
#
# The primary purpose of this code is to take short exposures with the guide
# camera and send instructions to the mount, in order to retain the same
# alignment throughout the . In the future we may wish to coordinate the guiding
# and capture so that we can add dithering, to even out pattern noise.
#
# Most logic happens in the background without user interaction. Within this mode
# the user can select:
#
# A to zoom in or out, intended to assist with prime focus.
#
# START to begin the calibration process.
#
# Otherwise a live view is always visible with various metadata including
# circles around the primary stars that are used for guiding, and basic stats
# about status, FWHM and a quality indicator.
#
# Everything is intended to be automatic, so the algorithm may choose to change
# the exposure time if it feels it would benefit from it.
